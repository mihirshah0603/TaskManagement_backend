# User Task Management App Backend

Welcome to the backend repository of the User Task Management App! This repository contains the backend codebase for our web application built with MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js.

## Features

- **Authentication and Authorization:** User authentication and authorization are handled using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), ensuring secure access to the application's resources.
- **CRUD Operations:** The backend provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks. Each user has access to their own tasks only.
- **Password Encryption:** User passwords are securely encrypted before storing them in the database.
- **Middleware Functions:** Middleware functions are used for handling request validation, authentication, and error handling.
- **RESTful API:** The backend follows RESTful principles, providing a clear and consistent API interface.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB
- Express.js
- Node.js
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- bcrypt (for password encryption)

## Getting Started

To get started with the backend development environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Configure environment variables (e.g., database connection string, JWT secret).
4. Run the development server using `npm start`.
5. The backend server should now be running at the specified port (default is 5000).

## API Endpoints

- **POST /api/auth/register:** Register a new user.
- **POST /api/auth/login:** Log in an existing user.
- **GET /api/tasks:** Get all tasks for the authenticated user.
- **POST /api/tasks:** Create a new task for the authenticated user.
- **PUT /api/tasks/:id:** Update an existing task for the authenticated user.
- **DELETE /api/tasks/:id:** Delete an existing task for the authenticated user.

For detailed documentation on each endpoint and their usage, refer to the API documentation provided in the source code.

## Deployment

The backend of the User Task Management App is deployed on [Back4App](https://www.back4app.com/), a platform for managing and deploying cloud-based applications.
